# GTK Journal
## An object oriented journal app written in C that uses the GTK framework

I want to keep a journal (but not really). What I'd rather do is find a programming project to work on when I don't feel like doing anything else.

This could be a good opportunity to learn more about object-oriented programming in C - something I've always been interested in.

### General Project Goals
1. Do the whole thing in object-oriented C (not C++)
2. Make something that saves some format of text that I could easily convert to something else when I inevitably move on to something else
3. Have fun

### General Plan
- Get a working window together in GTK-3
- Figure out how to make a little text editor
- Start saving files
- Brainstorm other features
- If I make it this far I'll be surprised

## DISCLAIMER
If you found this after a searching the internet for a GTK guide or something of that nature, know this: I have no idea what I'm doing and am just doing this for fun. NOT AN EXPERT.
